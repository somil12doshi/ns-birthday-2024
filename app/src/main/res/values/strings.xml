    <string name="message">I wish my closest friend "NIDHI SHAH" a very happy birthday ❤️. You are the person who have supported me and always will, and for that I am grateful 😊❤️. I am overwhelmed that you were there for me during the times when I needed assistance during the last three years. I appreciate that you always have empathy for me 🫡. One of the most significant persons in my life is you. There weren\'t many arguments between us, but we were able to work things out without causing each other harm because of our compassion and understanding for one another. Last but not least, I want to thank you for entering my life and filling the void of my best friend ❤️❤️.</string>
